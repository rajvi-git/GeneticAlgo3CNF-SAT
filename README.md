# GeneticAlgo3CNF-SAT
Implementation of the Genetic Algorithm to solve the 3CNF-SAT Problem

The code maximises the number of satisfied clauses in a given 3CNF sentence.The basic algorithm has been improved using the techniques of mutation, elitism, culling and random restart. The hyperâ€‘parameters have been optimized to ensure that the useful properties of the parent generation is preserved while the state space is sufficiently explored.
